Markdown
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John
Gruber and Aaron Swartz to help maximum readability and
"publishability" of both its input and output forms. The language
takes many cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in
email. Markdown converts its marked-up text input to valid,
well-formed XHTML and replaces left-pointing angle brackets ('<') and
ampersands with their corresponding character entity
references. Markdown was originally implemented in Perl by Gruber, but
has since been re-implemented by others in a variety of programming
languages. It is distributed under a BSD-style license and is included
with, or available as a plugin for, several content-management
systems.

Syntax examples

This is not an exhaustive listing of Markdown's syntax, and in many
cases multiple styles of syntax are available to accomplish a
particular effect. See the full Markdown syntax for more
information. Characters which are ordinarily interpreted by Markdown
as formatting commands will instead be interpreted literally if
preceded by a backslash; for example, the sequence '\*' would output
an asterisk rather than beginning a span of emphasized text. Markdown
also does not transform any text within a "raw" block-level XHTML
element; thus it is possible to include sections of XHTML within a
Markdown source document by wrapping them in block-level XHTML tags.

Paragraphs:

A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one
or more blank lines. Normal paragraphs should not be indented with
spaces or tabs:

This is a paragraph. It has two sentences.

This is another paragraph. It also has two sentences.

Emphasized text:

*emphasis* (e.g., italics)

**strong emphasis** (e.g., boldface)

Code:

`code`

Lists:

- An item in a bulleted (unordered) list
- Another item in a bulleted list

1. An item in an enumerated (ordered) list
2. Another item in an enumerated list

Headings:

HTML headings are produced by placing a number of hashes before the
header text corresponding to the level of heading desired (HTML offers
six levels of headings), like so:

# First-level heading

#### Fourth-level heading

The first two heading levels also have an alternate syntax:

First-level heading
===================

Second-level heading
--------------------

Blockquotes:

> This text will be enclosed in an HTML blockquote element.

Links:

[link text here](link.address.here "link title here")

Images:

![Alt text here](Image URL here "Image title here")

Horizontal rules are created by placing three or more hyphens,
asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. You may use spaces
between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will
produce a horizontal rule:

* * *
***
*****
- - -
